This project aims to implement a detector of pairs of similar Amazon books using **PySpark**. The similarity was copmuted based on both the user reviews and the books plot description.\
Both the <ins>Cosine Similarity</ins> and the <ins>Jaccard Similarity</ins> have been used, and the results have been compared.

> The code can be run either on Google Colab or using the loaded jupyter and python files.\
> A full PDF report is included.
